# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in data science and machine learning. It helps in understanding the dataset, identifying patterns, detecting anomalies, and making informed decisions about feature engineering and modeling.

It starts by loading raw data, clean it by removing noices, filling null values, univariate bivariate visualization, imputation and make it ready for machine learning.
